# PythonProjects
My first codes with Python.

These are all my codes. They are all the applications I'm doing while studying the language.
Feel free to browse  and, if possible, let me know what you think.. suggestions, tips or anything at all are very welcome.

I'm making this line with VSCode
I look forward to get see this on github!

i'm actually enjoying this.
